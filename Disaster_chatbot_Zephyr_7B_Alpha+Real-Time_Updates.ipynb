Almost 3,000structures were reported to have been either damaged ordestroyed by the ﬁre. In addition to the ﬁres on Maui, a series ofless devastating wildﬁres burned parts of the island of Hawaiistarting on August 9.CausesWhile local and state government ofﬁcials have hesitated to identify a speciﬁc cause of the wildﬁres (ingeneral, uncontrolled ﬁres in a forest, grassland, brushland, or cropland) as of August 17, some evidencesuggests that sparks produced by a downed power line may have touched off at least one of the ﬁres.Meteorologists and climate researchers noted that the ﬁres were likely to have been the product of severalintersecting factors. The ﬁres occurred at the height of Hawaii’s dry season (which lasts from April toOctober). Their severity was exacerbated by the presence of El Niño—that is, the development of unusuallywarm ocean waters in the central and eastern tropical Paciﬁc Ocean. El Niño brings increased rainfall to SouthAmerica’s west coast but brings drought conditions to the Hawaiian Islands. Indeed, the interval of June toAugust 2023 was a period of worsening drought on Maui and in other parts of Hawaii. As the droughtincreased in severity, it dried vegetation, much of it made up of large tracts of ﬁre-prone invasive shrubs andgrasses.In addition, the pool of warm water in the tropical Paciﬁc kept fueling Hurricane Dora, a powerful tropicalcyclone that had formed off the western coast of Mexico on August 2. Dora passed some 1,100 km (about 700miles) south of the Hawaiian Islands during the week of August 8, the day the ﬁres began, which created asubstantial difference in atmospheric pressure between the storm and a high-pressure system located north ofthe islands. That pressure difference drew high winds southward and funneled them into the centre of the', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/NeurIPS Outreach/Dataset/Dominick Pelaia - Wildfires/#1, Maui wildfires of 2023 -- Britannica Online Encyclopedia.pdf', 'page': 0}), Document(page_content='6/21/24, 1:57\\u202fPMMaui wildfires of 2023 -- Britannica Online Encyclopedia\\nPage 2 of 4https://www.britannica.com/print/article/2229349tropical cyclone, which helped intensify and spread the wildﬁres. Wind speeds reached as high as 107.8 km(67 miles) per hour on Maui and up to 132 km (82 miles) per hour on the island of Hawaii.Some researchers have noted that climate change may have played a part in worsening the wildﬁres’ severity.Increases in global and regional surface temperatures due to ongoing global warming are thought to havecaused grasses and other vegetation to dry out faster than usual. In addition, studies that considered trends inHawaii’s rainfall indicated that some 90 percent of the state had experienced at least some decline in overallrainfall between 1920 and 2012 and that rainfall amounts at higher elevations had fallen by more than 30percent between 1990 and 2015 during the state’s wet season (November to March). In addition, thereplacement of native vegetation with crops over the last century has affected local climate conditions,primarily in accessible areas in several parts of the state of Hawaii, including near sections of coastline and inMaui’s central valley—the sites of the island’s wildﬁres.Pace of the ﬁresThe ﬁre near Lahaina, a municipality of 12,702 people, began as a small brush ﬁre just beyond the town’seastern outskirts in the early morning hours of August 8. Although local ofﬁcials considered it to have beencontained by mid-morning, the ﬁre ﬂared up during mid-afternoon, forcing ofﬁcials to close Lahaina’s bypassroad. Driven by the high winds, the ﬁre then moved downslope into the town, and it spread quickly betweenthe parched grassy landscape and the town’s predominantly wooden buildings, generating an immense wall ofblack smoke. Within 15 minutes, the ﬁre had spread to the centre of the town, burning the area between thetown’s two primary access roads, which prompted additional road closures that hindered evacuation. Theprocess of alerting residents to the danger was severely hampered by the toppling of several telephone andelectric power poles in the area by high winds earlier that day, which had cut power needed for wirelessservices and telephone lines used for 911 emergency communication. As the ﬁre grew, it became so intensethat it melted pipes delivering water to Lahaina’s residences, which reduced the town’s overall water pressureand thus inhibited the ﬁre department’s ability to contain the wildﬁre.By 5:30 PM large areas of Lahaina, which included tracts of residences and the town’s central business district,were on ﬁre as exploding gasoline tanks in vehicles and ﬁlling stations contributed to the conﬂagration. Sinceemergency services had no way to alert people through their mobile devices, the ﬁre caught many residents bysurprise, forcing some to ﬂee in haste while trapping others in their homes. Many of those who ﬂed becameboxed in by ﬁre, smoke, and road closures; some sheltered in place, whereas others sought refuge in thePaciﬁc Ocean, clinging to docks, pilings, seawalls, and other infrastructure. By 7:00 PM the ﬁre had reachedthe harbour, and boats caught ﬁre from the mix of wind-whipped ﬂames and ﬂying embers, causing their fuel', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/NeurIPS Outreach/Dataset/Dominick Pelaia - Wildfires/#1, Maui wildfires of 2023 -- Britannica Online Encyclopedia.pdf', 'page': 1}), Document(page_content='6/21/24, 1:57\\u202fPMMaui wildfires of 2023 -- Britannica Online Encyclopedia\\nPage 3 of 4https://www.britannica.com/print/article/2229349\\nMaui wildﬁres of 2023Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii, after beingstruck by a wildﬁre in August 2023.Nearly 3,000 structures there weredamaged or destroyed.tanks to explode. Although the ﬁre continued to burn in Lahaina throughout the night, U.S. Coast Guard boatsarriving offshore were able to evacuate several people trapped along the coast.During the morning of August 9 the winds abated enough to allow ﬁreﬁghting crews, helicopters, and otherresources to begin to make their way into Lahaina, where they found a grayed landscape of ruined buildingsand burned-out vehicles. Ofﬁcials reported that the Lahaina ﬁre had been 80 percent contained by August 10and that it had burned nearly 890 hectares (about 2,200 acres) by August 14. Maui’s other wildﬁres, whichincluded the Pulehu/Kihei ﬁre in Maui’s central valley and the Upcountry/Kula ﬁre along the slopes of theisland’s eastern peninsula, were less severe, resulting in far fewer damaged homes and other structures and noreports of serious injuries or deaths. Similarly, on the island of Hawaii, ﬁres scorched some 600 hectares(about 1,500 acres) of ranchland in the North and South Kohala sections of the island, but no injuries werereported.Relief and recoveryEven as the ﬁres began to spread on Maui, government ofﬁcialsstarted to issue disaster declarations to fund ﬁreﬁghting efforts,rescues, and recovery. Hawaii’s lieutenant governor, Sylvia Luke,issued an emergency declaration during mid-afternoon of August8, which was followed later that evening by the activation ofHawaii’s National Guard. The following day, as reports of theunfolding disaster in Lahaina reached the outside world, the U.S.Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) authorizedpayments to ﬁre victims, and U.S. Pres. Joe Biden promised that“all available Federal assets on the Islands” would assist in reliefefforts.

Common to these wildﬁres was the occurrence of violent pyroconvection. This\\nwork presents a meteorological analysis of this outbreak of extreme pyroconvective wildﬁres. Our\\nanalysis shows that dry and warm antecedent weather preconditioned fuels in the ﬁre-affected areas,\\ncreating a ﬁre environment that alone could effectively support intense wildﬁre activity. Analysis of\\nsurface conditions revealed that the ignition and the most active spread of all wildﬁres coincided\\nwith the most adverse ﬁre weather since the beginning of the ﬁre season. Further, the atmospheric\\nenvironment was conducive to violent pyroconvection, as atmospheric instability gradually increased\\namid the breakdown of an upper-air ridge ahead of an approaching long-wave trough. In summary,\\nwe highlight that the severity and extent of the 2021 Greek wildﬁres were not surprising considering\\nthe ﬁre weather potential for the period when they ignited. Continuous monitoring of the large-\\nand local-scale conditions that promote extreme ﬁre behavior is imperative for improving Greece’s\\ncapacity for managing extreme wildﬁres.\\nKeywords: extreme ﬁre behavior; ﬁre weather; pyroconvection; ﬂammability; early warning; August\\n2021; Greece; Mediterranean\\n1. Introduction\\nThe wildﬁres that burnt across Greece in early August 2021 were unprecedented\\nin extent, intensity, and impacts. They broke out in the regions of Attica, Euboea, Elis,\\nMessenia, and Laconia (Figure 1) on 3 and 4 August 2021 and kept burning for several\\ndays. According to the European Forest Fire Information System (EFFIS; https://efﬁs.jrc.ec.\\neuropa.eu, accessed on 20 February 2022), the ﬁve wildﬁres collectively burnt nearly 94,000\\nha, a surface that accounts for more than 70% of the 2021 total burnt area and equals almost\\nthree times the 2008–2021 annual average burnt area. Observational evidence indicates that\\nall wildﬁres showed extreme ﬁre behavior, characterized by erratic ﬁre spread, massive\\nspotting, and the occurrence of pyroconvection (Figure 1).\\nRare and large wildﬁres have historically characterized ﬁre regimes around the globe\\n(e.g., the 1910s in Northern Rockies, USA; 1939 Black Friday bushﬁres in Victoria, Australia;\\nthe 1949 wildﬁre in Landes, France). However, recent catastrophic events like the 2021 Greek\\nwildﬁres (e.g., 2017 in Chile and Portugal; 2018 in California, USA; 2020 in Australia; 2021\\nin British Columbia, Canada) suggest the emergence of novel ﬁre regimes, characterized\\nby the occurrence of extreme wildﬁres [ 1].

Following Bradstock [ 22] and Boer et al. [ 23], four principal\\nenvironmental constraints, or “switches”, control the occurrence of major wildﬁres. These\\nswitches include (a) the accumulation of fuels to a level that supports ﬁre propagation, (b)\\nthe dry-out of fuels that allows for ignition and maintaining combustion, (c) a source of\\nignition (e.g., lightning, arson), and (d) ﬁre weather conditions that facilitate ﬁre spread.\\nTherefore, the factors that contributed to the recent extreme wildﬁres in Greece shall\\nbe sought in the combination of (1) antecedent meteorological conditions that allowed for\\nthe accumulation and extreme dry-out of fuels and (2) concurrent adverse ﬁre weather\\nthat enabled ignited wildﬁres to couple with the atmosphere and evolve into extreme\\npyroconvective events. These topics serve as the motivation of the current study, which\\npresents an analysis of the environmental conditions that led to the pyroconvection outbreak\\nof early August 2021 in Greece. Using both observational and large-scale meteorological\\nanalysis data, we examine the environmental conditions before and during the events.\\nWe demonstrate that the recent extreme wildﬁres resulted from a sequence of events that\\nessentially increased the potential for the occurrence of extreme pyroconvection. In that\\nregard, this study highlights the urgent need for better monitoring and early warning of\\nthe potential for extreme wildﬁres. This is a particularly important issue for countries that,\\nlike Greece, lack an open science-based early warning system of wildﬁre danger.\\n2. Data and Methods\\n2.1. Study Area and Examined Wildﬁres\\nThe present study focuses on ﬁve pyroconvective wildﬁres that affected southern\\nGreece (Figure 1) between 3 and 10 August 2021. Table 1 summarizes basic information\\nconcerning the examined events. The areas affected by the wildﬁres have a hot and dry\\nclimate and elevation that ranges from 200 to 800 m above sea level. Based on the fuel map\\nproduced by Giannaros et al. [ 24], the dominant vegetation types damaged by the wildﬁres\\ninclude coniferous and broadleaf forests, sclerophyllous shrublands, and agroforestry\\nland. The EMSR527b event was by far the most signiﬁcant, having burnt more than\\n50,000 ha, followed by EMSR528 and EMSR531, which burned more than 10,000 ha. All\\nwildﬁres, except EMSR532, broke out in the noon and early afternoon hours. Examination\\nof satellite imagery data indicates that all events developed pyroconvection, with the\\nﬁrst occurrence of pyroCus formation recorded during noon hours (Table 1). According\\nto observational evidence and satellite imagery data, the date with the most active and\\nwidespread pyroconvection was 5 August 2021.\\nTable 1.

Observational Data\\nTo assess environmental conditions before and during the examined wildﬁres, we\\nretrieved in situ meteorological observations from the network of automatic weather\\nstations (AWSs) operated by the National Observatory of Athens (NOA) in Greece since\\n2007 [ 26]. The AWSs employed in this analysis were selected based on their proximity to\\nthe ﬁre-affected regions (Figure 1), representativeness, and availability of data. The selected\\nAWSs are divided into two groups (Table 2). The ﬁrst group comprises the AWSs with at\\nleast 10 years of data availability that are closest to the ﬁre-affected regions. These were\\nexploited for evaluating antecedent conditions. The second group comprises the AWSs that\\nare nearest to the ignition locations and show the most complete data record. These were\\nused for investigating conditions during the wildﬁres.\\nHourly measurements of air temperature and relative humidity, wind speed and di-\\nrection, and accumulated precipitation were extracted from all available AWSs (Table 2). To\\nevaluate antecedent conditions, we ﬁrst calculated the December–July long-term averages\\n(reference period 2010–2019) of monthly accumulated precipitation and monthly mean\\nof daily maximum temperature at the locations of the AWSs of the ﬁrst group. Monthly\\naccumulated precipitation and monthly means of daily maximum temperature for the\\nyear 2020/2021 were then compared against the long-term averages. The data retrieved\\nfrom the AWSs of the second group were exploited for computing the components of\\nthe Canadian Forest Fire Weather Index System (CFFWIS) [ 27] that are relevant to ﬁre\\nbehavior and spread. These include the Initial Spread Index (ISI) and the Fire Weather\\nIndex (FWI), which are numeric ratings of the expected rate of spread and ﬁre intensity,\\nrespectively. The calculation of both indices was carried out using weather data valid at\\n12:00 UTC. Further, air temperature and relative humidity observations were exploited\\nfor estimating the fuel moisture content of dead ﬁne fuels (DFMC), a reliable measure of\\nlandscape ﬂammability [ 23]. For this, we followed the approach described in detail in\\nDragozi et al. [28].\\nIn addition to surface weather observations, satellite remote sensing data were em-\\nployed for investigating ﬁre evolution. Speciﬁcally, we retrieved estimates of ﬁre radiative', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/NeurIPS Outreach/Dataset/Dominick Pelaia - Wildfires/#9, Meteorological Analysis of the 2021 Extreme Wildfires in Greece: Lessons Learned and Implications for Early Warning of the Potential for Pyroconvection.pdf', 'page': 3}), Document(page_content='Atmosphere 2022 ,13, 475 5 of 13\\npower (FRP) from the Land Surface Analysis Satellite Applications Facility (LSA SAF) [ 29].\\nThe ~5 ×5 km spatial resolution and 15 min temporal resolution FRP data are produced\\nby processing satellite imagery provided by the Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared\\nImager (SEVIRI) onboard the Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) series of geostationary\\nmeteorological satellites [ 30]. FRP is commonly used as a surrogate for monitoring ﬁre\\nintensity since it provides information relevant to the radiant heat output of detected\\nﬁres e.g., refs. [ 19,31–33]. To derive a consistent and representative time series of FRP , the\\noriginal data were aggregated hourly for each wildﬁre and the resulting total instantaneous\\nFRP was divided by the number of available detections per hour.\\n2.3. Model Data\\nThe 0.25◦×0.25◦spatial resolution and hourly temporal resolution, surface and upper-\\nair ERA5 reanalyses data of the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts\\n(ECMWF) were used for examining synoptic weather patterns during the 2021 extreme\\nwildﬁres in Greece. The speciﬁc variables analyzed include 500 hPa geopotential heights,\\nrelative humidity, and wind.\\n3. Results\\n3.1. Evolution of Events from Satellite Observations\\nThe hourly normalized FRP time series, shown in Figure 2, indicate a characteristic,\\nweather-driven diurnal cycle of FRP that ﬂuctuates between maxima in the late afternoon\\nand evening, and minima in the late morning. It is worth noting that cloud cover can\\nseverely compromise the satellite-derived FRP data. For instance, intermittent convection\\nover the region of the EMSR531 event on 3 and 4 August resulted in a large data gap in the\\nrespective FRP time series (Figure 2d). Large data gaps are also evident in the FRP time\\nseries for the EMSR527b event, attributed to the presence of thick smoke and high clouds\\n(cirrus, altostratus), particularly between 5 and 6 August (Figure 2b). For the EMSR527a\\nevent, the absence of FRP data on 4 August is due to the wildﬁre being inactive (Figure 2a);\\nthe wildﬁre was partially contained early in the morning of 4 August and resurged in the\\nnoon of 5 August. In contrast, clear-sky conditions prevailed during the EMSR528 and\\nEMSR532 events, resulting in only minor data gaps in the corresponding FRP time series\\n(Figure 2c,d, respectively).\\nPrevious studies have associated FRP variations with the intensity of burning, sug-\\ngesting that the largest FRP values should point to periods of most intense burning e.g.,\\nrefs. [ 19,34]. In turn, this implies that FRP peaks could be linked to the development of\\npyroconvection since for the latter to be triggered, intense surface heating is required. Ex-\\namination of Figure 2 along with satellite imagery conﬁrms this assumption, as pyroclouds\\nwere found to cooccur with the maxima of FRP . For instance, the three maxima of FRP seen\\nin the time series for the EMSR527b wildﬁre, on 3, 5, and 6 August (Figure 2b), coincide\\nwith the occurrence of the most intense pyroconvection. In addition, the absolute maximum\\nof FRP for the EMSR527a wildﬁre, on 5 August (Figure 2a), was found to coincide with the\\nformation of a large pyroCb (Figure 1b).', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/NeurIPS Outreach/Dataset/Dominick Pelaia - Wildfires/#9, Meteorological Analysis of the 2021 Extreme Wildfires in Greece: Lessons Learned and Implications for Early Warning of the Potential for Pyroconvection.pdf', 'page': 4}), Document(page_content='Atmosphere 2022 ,13, 475 6 of 13\\nAtmosphere 2022 , 12, x FOR PEER REVIEW 6 of 13 \\n \\n  \\nFigure 2.

Antecedent Conditions and Fuels \\nThe temperate forests of southern Greece ar e mainly composed of species adapted to \\nhot and dry environments, such as Pinus halepensis , Pinus brutia , and most of the evergreen \\nbroadleaves [35]. In general, plant biomass is abundant enough to sustain fire spread, mainly due to the unbalanced policy adopted by the Greek state, which heavily promotes \\nfire suppression over sustainable forest mana gement [36]. Therefore, the main factor lim-\\niting the extent and severity of wildfires is the moisture content of available fuels. \\nFigure 3 shows the time series of the December–July monthly accumulated precipi-\\ntation and monthly mean of daily maximum air temperature compared against the corre-sponding long-term means (Table 2). Except for December and January, which proved to \\nbe wetter than average in most AWSs, the reco rded late winter (February) and springtime \\nprecipitation were in general below normal. Precipitation deficits were found to be maxi-\\nmum in February, ranging from −72.1 mm (EMSR528; Figure 3c) to −23.4 mm (EMSR532; \\nFigure 3d). Focusing on the fire season mont hs (May–July), it is wo rth noticing that May \\nand July were marked by the absence of any significant precipitation in almost all fire-\\naffected regions, while June was locally wett er than average due to convective activity \\nthat took place during the first half of the month. In terms of temperatures, the fire-af-\\nfected regions were characterized by warmer than average conditions throughout the De-\\ncember–July period, except for March and Apri l, which showed negative temperature de-\\npartures. Altogether, the warm and dry condit ions that prevailed during the months pre-\\nceding August 2021 should ha ve contributed to preconditi oning fuels by promoting dry-\\ning, thereby supporting wildfire activity. \\nFigure 2.

Antecedent Conditions and Fuels\\nThe temperate forests of southern Greece are mainly composed of species adapted to\\nhot and dry environments, such as Pinus halepensis ,Pinus brutia , and most of the evergreen\\nbroadleaves [ 35]. In general, plant biomass is abundant enough to sustain ﬁre spread,\\nmainly due to the unbalanced policy adopted by the Greek state, which heavily promotes\\nﬁre suppression over sustainable forest management [ 36]. Therefore, the main factor\\nlimiting the extent and severity of wildﬁres is the moisture content of available fuels.\\nFigure 3 shows the time series of the December–July monthly accumulated precipi-\\ntation and monthly mean of daily maximum air temperature compared against the cor-\\nresponding long-term means (Table 2). Except for December and January, which proved\\nto be wetter than average in most AWSs, the recorded late winter (February) and spring-\\ntime precipitation were in general below normal. Precipitation deﬁcits were found to\\nbe maximum in February, ranging from −72.1 mm (EMSR528; Figure 3c) to −23.4 mm\\n(EMSR532; Figure 3d). Focusing on the ﬁre season months (May–July), it is worth noticing\\nthat May and July were marked by the absence of any signiﬁcant precipitation in almost\\nall ﬁre-affected regions, while June was locally wetter than average due to convective\\nactivity that took place during the ﬁrst half of the month. In terms of temperatures, the\\nﬁre-affected regions were characterized by warmer than average conditions throughout the\\nDecember–July period, except for March and April, which showed negative temperature\\ndepartures.

Otherwise they arelearning to let some fires burnthemselves out, as nature intended.Wildfires Can Have Long-LastingImplications for Our PlanetForest fires actually have the ability toheat up the entire planet, a NASA studyfrom 2016 revealed.
